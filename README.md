# Lashhh by Belle - A booking system for a lash extension salon.

### End user's goal:

Be able to make booking appointments and receive information back about prices, packages, quotas etc.

### Site/business owner's goals:

Make sure no duplicate appointments are made, have a clear and concise booking system, and be able to give the user as much information and hospitality as possible.

The site needs to show the elegance of the business, and and the same time be extremely functional and eye-grabbing.
